## Project Objective

This graduate independent study project investigates whether quantum computing techniques can enhance document reranking in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Specifically, we're developing a hybrid quantum-classical architecture that leverages quantum circuit-based similarity functions to improve context selection for energy forecast analysis using ERCOT data.

The research focuses on:
- Implementing quantum state encoding for documents and queries
- Comparing quantum similarity measures against classical methods
- Building an agent-based controller to optimize the reranking process
- Evaluating performance across multiple LLM backends

This work explores the intersection of quantum information theory and natural language processing, with potential applications in energy system forecasting and operational analysis.
