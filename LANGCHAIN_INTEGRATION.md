# LangChain Integration Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to integrate LangChain into the quantum reranking project.

## Overview

The integration of LangChain has enhanced the RAG pipeline with more modular, powerful components that are easier to maintain and extend. LangChain provides high-level abstractions for embeddings, vector stores, document processing, reranking, and generation, allowing for more flexible implementations and easier experimentation with different approaches.

## Key Changes

1. **Requirements Update**
   - Added `langchain~=0.0.267` and `langchain-community~=0.0.10` to requirements.txt

2. **Embeddings Module**
   - Integrated LangChain's embedding interfaces (HuggingFaceEmbeddings, OpenAIEmbeddings)
   - Added fallback to original implementations when LangChain is not available

3. **Document Loading**
   - Added LangChain document loaders for PDF, CSV, and text files
   - Implemented document splitting with RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
   - Enhanced ERCOT data processing with LangChain's structured document loading

4. **Vector Store**
   - Integrated LangChain's FAISS vector store implementation
   - Added methods to convert between application Document objects and LangChain Document format
   - Implemented retriever interfaces for LangChain chain integration

5. **Classical Reranker**
   - Added LangChain's ContextualCompressionRetriever
   - Implemented document compressors (LLMChainExtractor, LLMChainFilter) for reranking
   - Created ListRetriever for working with document sets

6. **Generator**
   - Implemented LLM chains for text generation
   - Added ChatPromptTemplate for structured prompts
   - Integrated with multiple LLM backends through LangChain interfaces

7. **Agent**
   - Added LangChain's agent-based decision making for reranker selection
   - Implemented tools for classical and quantum reranking
   - Enhanced query analysis with additional helper methods

8. **New Integrations Module**
   - Created LangChainPipeline for end-to-end RAG with quantum reranking
   - Implemented runnable chains and document processing utilities
   - Added document conversion helpers for working with both formats

9. **API Routes**
   - Added new endpoint for the LangChain pipeline (/api/langchain)
   - Implemented dependency injection for LangChain components

10. **Helper Scripts**
    - Created start_with_langchain.sh to handle dependencies and startup
    - Added langchain_example.py to demonstrate full pipeline usage

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Modularity**: Components can be swapped easily (e.g., embedding models, LLMs)
- **Better Reranking**: Access to more sophisticated reranking techniques through LLM-powered document compressors
- **Improved Document Processing**: Better chunking and handling of different document types
- **More Powerful Agents**: Decision-making about which reranker to use is now more sophisticated
- **Full Pipeline Integration**: End-to-end chains that tie together all components
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Systems fall back to traditional implementations when LangChain isn't available

## Usage

To run the application with LangChain:

```bash
./scripts/start_with_langchain.sh
```

To try the example script:

```bash
python scripts/langchain_example.py
```

Access the LangChain endpoint via:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/langchain

## Notes

- All original functionality is preserved with fallbacks when LangChain is not available
- Integration is designed to be non-disruptive to existing code
- Additional configuration parameters allow fine-tuning of LangChain components
