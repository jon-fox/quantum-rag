# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Approach

- **Analyze before acting**: Carefully read and interpret each request. Ask for clarification if the intent or scope isnâ€™t clear.
- **Be targeted**: Only modify the specific code or file sections relevant to the request. Avoid touching unrelated areas.
- **Minimize changes**: Keep diffs small. Do not introduce unnecessary complexity, dependencies, or abstractions.

## Code Quality

- Follow existing conventions (formatting, naming, patterns).
- Favor simplicity and readability over cleverness.
- **Comment sparingly**: Only add comments where necessary to clarify non-obvious logic.

## Communication

- When in doubt, propose options instead of committing uncertain changes.
- Provide brief rationale for any suggestions or code snippets.
- **No terminal commands**: Do not suggest executing commands in the terminal.
- **Be concise**: Keep explanations and summaries brief and to the point.
