# MCP Server

This directory contains an stdio Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation.

## Purpose

The MCP server provides:
- Query intent classification
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) operations
- Energy data analysis capabilities

## Architecture

- **stdio interface**: Standard input/output communication protocol
- **Intent processing**: Classifies user queries and routes to appropriate handlers
- **RAG integration**: Leverages the quantum-enhanced retrieval system for contextual responses

## Usage

The server will be designed to work with MCP-compatible clients, providing a standardized interface for energy data queries and analysis.
