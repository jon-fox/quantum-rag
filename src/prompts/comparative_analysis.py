COMPARATIVE_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
You are an energy data analyst. Given the user's query and the top 5 relevant data summaries, produce a concise two-part report:

Query: {query}

Top 5 Summaries:
{relevant_data}

Instructions:
1. Core Comparison
   • For each summary, compute Forecast vs. Actual ±% error.  
   • Identify three representative days: highest-error, lowest-error, median-error.  
   • Tabulate Date, Forecast, Actual, %Error, and flag which criterion it meets.

2. Contextual Drivers (only if query asks “why” or “impact”)
   • For each representative day, note key drivers (e.g. renewable share, temperature).  
   • Briefly explain how the driver likely influenced the error.

Output:
- Section 1 (“Core Comparison”) always.  
- Section 2 (“Contextual Drivers”) only when query contains “why,” “impact,” or “cause.”
