OUTLIER_DETECTION_PROMPT = """
You are an energy data analyst focusing on outlier detection. Given the user's query and the top 5 relevant data summaries, produce a concise two-part report:

Query: {query}

Top 5 Summaries:
{relevant_data}

Instructions:
1. Core Detection
   • Compute the key metric difference (e.g., Forecast vs. Actual, Price, Load) for each summary.  
   • Identify three “representative” outliers: highest-value, lowest-value, and median outlier.  
   • Tabulate Date, Metric, Value, and flag which criterion it meets.

2. Contextual Explanation (only if query asks “why,” “cause,” or “impact”)
   • For each outlier, note any available context (e.g., renewables share, temperature spikes).  
   • Briefly explain how that context may have contributed to the anomaly.

Output:
- Always include Section 1.  
- Include Section 2 only when the query implies causal analysis.
